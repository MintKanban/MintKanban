## About tmrw

TMRW is a single page app that allows a single user to create a customizable planner
and to store their plans, goals, and tasks all in one place.  The information that 
the user puts on this Kanban board is saved to local storage so the user can come 
back to revisit their goals.

TMRW was created in three days as part of the JavaScript Olmpics Hack-a-thon 
hosted by [Mintbean](https://www.mintbean.io/)
